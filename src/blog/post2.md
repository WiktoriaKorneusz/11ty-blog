We often hear about semantics, but not many of
us do exactly know what does semantics mean.
Semantics is the study of the meanings of
phrases and word in language in a particular
context. But how does it connect with web
development and what is semantic html?

Original design of html was simple, but as internet started growing, html started evolving, and a lot of more elements such as header or nav started occurring. They often act like div, but do we really need them?

When it comes to compare the ‘old’ way to create semantic elements and ‘new’ one. We see that the second one is easier to read and it has greater accessibility.
- &lt;article&gt; specifies independent content; it should make sense at its own and should be independent from the rest of the website
- &lt;aside&gt; defines content aside from other content. it can be for example sidebar
- &lt;details&gt; defines more content than can be hidden or shown by user
- &lt;figcaption&gt; is a caption for element
- &lt;figure&gt; defines content like illustrations, diagrams, photos, etc.
- &lt;footer&gt; specifies footer for website or section. it often contains information such as: copyright, sitemap, contact etc.
- &lt;header&gt; is an element that represents introductory content. it often contains: logo, heading elements, authorship.
- &lt;hgroup&gt; is an element that contains main heading and subheadings
- &lt;main&gt; is an element that contains main content of a document
- &lt;mark&gt; defines marked text
- &lt;nav&gt; is an element that contains navigation links
- &lt;section&gt; defines a section of a document. i thematically groups content
- &lt;small&gt; defines element with information such as copyright or disclaimer
- &lt;summary&gt; is element that defines visible heading for element
- &lt;time&gt; defines data and/or time
