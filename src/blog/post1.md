Color theory is collection of basic rules that every designer should know. Color theory can help designers create better designs that not only look good, but also to communicate with users. Colors can give life to our projects, but they can also affect our mood and perceptions. Even ancient civilizations noticed this fact, and used it for 'color therapy'.

  

In color theory we have 3 basic categories: color harmony, color wheel and color context. 

  

### Color wheel 

  

color wheel is probably most popular part of color theory. even non designers know about it, but what exactly is color wheel? 

  

Isaac Newton set up color theory in 1666, when he invented the color wheel. he categorized colors into 3 groups: primary (red, yellow, blue), secondary (green, violet, orange), tertiary (other colors). after that artists and scientists has designed way more variants of color wheel concept, including the concepts of hue, chroma and lighting, which are well known in modern UI design 

  

### Color harmony 

  

Harmony is often associated with music, but it is used in many other contexts. The basic definition of harmony is combination of differed things that is pleasing. In design context harmony is combination of colors that pleases our eyes 

  

In fact, there is a lot of theories for color harmony. They are often called color themes, and most popular ones are: complementary (2 colors on the opposite sites of color wheel), analogous (3 colors placed next to each other on the color wheel), triadic (3 colors that creates an equilateral triangle on color wheel), monochromatic (only one color), split-complementary color (instead of one complementary color to selected, we get 2 close to the complementary on, so we get 3 colors), tetradic (2 pairs of complementary colors, that makes an square on color wheel) 

  

### Color context 

  

Color context can show us how our color behaves in relation to other visual forms (e.g., colors, shapes). If it comes to color concept we must take care of contrast, warmth/coolness, saturation and hue
